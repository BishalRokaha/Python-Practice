## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of Python exercises and projects I have worked on. It aims to showcase my journey in mastering Python programming through practical examples and a real-world project.

## Concepts Covered

The repository includes practice exercises and code examples for the following Python concepts:

- **Conditionals**: Understanding and implementing decision-making structures.
- **Decorators**: Creating function decorators to enhance or modify existing function behavior.
- **Functions**: Exploring function definitions, parameter handling, and scope.
- **Loops**: Utilizing various looping mechanisms for efficient iteration.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Demonstrating classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- **Database Management with SQLite**: Implementing database operations using SQLite.

## Project: YouTube Manager

In addition to practice exercises, I have developed a project called **YouTube Manager**. This project is designed to manage and organize YouTube content efficiently. It demonstrates the application of Python concepts in a practical setting, including:

- Retrieving YouTube video information.
- Adding a video name with time.
- Updating a video name with time.
- deleting a video name with time.
- Storing and organizing data using an SQLite database.
